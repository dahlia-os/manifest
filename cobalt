    This manifest is used only for the Cobalt stand-alone CQ & CI. By stand-
    alone we mean that the Cobalt project is not being used as a part of
    Fuchsia but rather as an independent project that is agnostic of Fuchsia.
    This manifest is not used in the Fuchsia build. Do not import this manifest
    into any other manifest that is used in the Fuchsia build. The Cobalt
    repository is pulled into the Fuchsia build not through this manifest but
    rather through the "garnet" manifest which maps the Cobalt repo to
    the path "third_party/cobalt" so that in a Fuchsia check-out Cobalt may
    be found at //third_party/cobalt. Below we map instead to the path "cobalt"
    (no third_party) because the stand-alone build for cobalt expects to
    find the code at //cobalt.
